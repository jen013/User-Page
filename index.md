## Biography
> I'm a third year student studying for my B.S. in Computer Science. Within the field, I am interested in learning more about artificial intelligence and cyber security, though I want to keep my options open and continue to explore different specializations. At the moment, I am also considering a minor in environmental studies and/or pursuing my master’s. Outside of school, I sketch and paint in my free time, but recently, I’ve also been looking into doing digital illustration.
